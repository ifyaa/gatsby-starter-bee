"Chirp chirp ~

Sang Grsshopper, resting on  tree on a hot summer day.
While under the tree, Ant was sweating and slaving away.

"Heave ho~ heave ho~!"
Hey Ant!"Life is too short to work so hard!"
Grasshopper said to Ant because Ant was working all summer long.
"Listen Grasshopper,  if you don't prepare for winter now, your're going to starve!  Heave ho~!"

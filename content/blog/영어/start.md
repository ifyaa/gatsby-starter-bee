The Ant and the Grasshopper

"Chirp chirp ~  
love summer!Chirp chirp~ I love singing.Chirp :

  
Sang Grsshopper, resting on tree on a hot summer day.  
While under the tree, Ant was sweating and slaving away.  

"Heave ho~ heave ho~!"

Hey Ant!"Life is too short to work so hard!"  
Grasshopper said to Ant because Ant was working all summer long.  
"Listen Grasshopper, if you don't prepare for winter now, your're going to starve! Heave ho~!"  

--------------

  

**"Oh, there's plenty of time...  
  
Why worry?"  
  
"I'm going to go back to my singing now."  
  
"Chirp~ chirp!"  
  
  
In no time, summer went and the freezing winter came.  
The wind howled and howled and buckets of snow fell from the winter sky.**  
**  
"Oh... I'm so hungry."  
  
"I'm so cold."  
  
"What if Ant is right  
  
and I starve to death?"  
**

  

The Ant and the Grasshopper

**  
  
Grasshopper went to look for food.  
But instead of finding food, he got lost in the snow.  
And, he could barely move his legs anymore.  
Luckily, Grsshopper found Ant's house.  
He mustered up enough energy to knock on the door.**
